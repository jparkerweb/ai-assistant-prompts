# Vibe Architecting Flow
The Goal of this series of propts is to creat a well crafted `Statement of Work`, that breaks down your feature into Epics and Stories.

1. Add your "Brainstorming" Notes to the `<brainstorm-document>` tag in `1-deep-research-prep-prompt.md`, then copy/paste that as a prmopt to a capable LLM UI, like Claude or Gemini 2.5 Pro (https://ai.dev/).

2. Take the results from step 1 and copy/paste into a Deep Research LLM UI (e.g. Perplexity.ai with the Deep Research option toggled on; other paid options are Gemini Advanced or ChatGPT). Save the results (I suggest `deep-research.md`).

3. Add both your "Brainstorming" Notes and "Deep Reaserch" resulst and apply them to the correspoinding tags at the bottom of `2-prd-prep-prompt.md`. Save the output (I suggest a file called `PRD.md`).

4. Gather your "Brainstorming" Notes, "Deep Reaserch" resulst, and `PRD`; Apply them to the correspoinding tags at the bottom of `3-epic-story-creation-prompt.md`. Paste this prompt in a capable LLM UI (a thinking LLM like Gemini 2.5 Pro is a great choice as it also has a large context window, https://ai.dev/) and save the results to a `SOW.md` file. This file can be used to work on the features requested.
