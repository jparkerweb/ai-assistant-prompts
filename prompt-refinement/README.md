# Prompt Refinement
Prompt technique to `evaluate` and `refine` your existing prompts.

These two prompts are written to elevate your prompts from mediocre to professional. One prompt evaluates, the other one refines. You can use them separately until your prompt is perfect.

The evaluation prompt evaluates your prompt against 35 criteria, everything from clarity, logic, tone, hallucination risks and many more.
The refinement prompt rewrites your prompt using those insights.

ðŸ’ª Feel free to edit these two prompts as needed. This combo of evaluation then refinement is very powerful!

## How To Use It (Step-by-step)
1. *Evaluate*: Paste the first prompt (`1-evaluate.md`) into ChatGPT (or an equivalent LLM), then paste *YOUR* prompt inside triple backticks at the end. When run it will rate your prompt across all the criteria and output a report.
2. *Refine*: Paste the second prompt (`2-refine.md`). It will processes the previously generated report and use it to craft a new improved version of *YOUR* prompt.
3. *Repeat*: Repeat this process as many times as needed until you are happy with the results.
