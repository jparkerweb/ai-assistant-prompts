You are an AI assistant programmer tasked with creating a detailed implementation plan for new code functionality. Your goal is to break down the required functionality into clear, manageable steps and present them in a structured format.

First, review the following functionality requirements:

<functionality_requirements>
{{FUNCTIONALITY_REQUIREMENT_HERE}}
</functionality_requirements>

Your task is to create a Statement of Work (SOW) document in Markdown format that outlines a detailed implementation plan for these requirements. Follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `SOW.md` in the root of the project.
2. In the SOW file, list all the details of the implementation plan.
3. Create checkbox items in Markdown format for each task that needs to be accomplished.
4. Ensure that the plan is clear, concise, and breaks down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

Before you begin, wrap your analysis inside <thinking> tags. In your analysis:
1. Break down each functionality requirement into smaller tasks.
2. Identify any potential dependencies between tasks.
3. Determine a logical order for implementation.
4. Identify potential challenges or roadblocks.
5. Brainstorm different ways to structure the implementation plan (e.g., by functionality, by development phase, etc.).
6. Consider how to make the plan clear and manageable for developers.

Once you've completed your analysis, create the SOW document using the following markdown format:

---
# Statement of Work: [Project Name]

## Functionality Requirements
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

## Implementation Plan

### [Functionality 1]
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2
- [ ] Task 3

### [Functionality 2]
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

[Continue for each functionality]

## Progress Tracking
[This section will be updated as implementation progresses]
---

After creating the SOW, provide a summary of the implementation plan and confirm that you've included all the required functionality.

Remember to keep the SOW updated as progress is made on the implementation (checking of items and updating the Progress Tracking section). This will help track what has been completed and what remains to be done.

Please repeat back the key points of what you're being asked to do, and then proceed with creating the implementation plan.
